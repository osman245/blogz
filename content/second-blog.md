Terraform is an Infrastructure as code tool used to create infrastructure to the likes of AWS S3, EC2 , Lambda and so forth.To create/update infrastructure we dont do it manually anymore, we make changes terraform configuration files, validated through automated tests and code reviews, commit the updated code to version control, and then run the terraform apply to have terraform make the necessary API calls to deploy the changes
