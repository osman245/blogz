javaScript fundamentals. I've been going into depth with Object Oriented programming in JavaScript. OOP gives another layer to Javascript that can be tapped into. I marvel at the cleanliness and structure of a project that use OOP. Ive been taking this course on Udemy to help with my javascript studies, plan on finishing most of it by the end of the week and get started with reactJs next week.
