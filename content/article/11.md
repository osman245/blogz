We have AWS S3, Regional based. We have buckets that store objects., these objects have a full path called “key”.We let people access the s3 bucket through bucket policys, IAM policies or IAM roles. We can make a static website through a bucket, by setting an index.html file. We can enable versioning to our buckets. Amazon replication based ( CRR & SRR). Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets. Copying is asynchronous. Must give proper IAM permissions to AWS S3. To replicate go to management, then replication rule use  CRR for compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts and SRR for log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts. it is important to use Multi part upload if a file is greater then 5GB.We have 3 diff types of storage classes we have s3 standard, 99.9% availability and has low latency.We have S3 infrequent access(IA and one-zone), cheaper then s3 standard. Rapid access to storage, One-zone has more durability but less availability. We have S3 Glacier Access (instant(seconds) flexible(minutes + hours) bulk(12hrs,48hours)) used for  low-cost object storage meant for archiving, and Pricing is price for storage + obj retrieval cost. We also can create lifecycles where we can transition our objects into diff versions of storage classes depending on how long it wasnt accessed for.
