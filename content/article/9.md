Route 53 is a high available DNS service we use in order to register domains and create hosted zones that determine how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains.  We have public hosted zones we use in order to manage public domain names accessible over the internet. We have private hosted zones in order to that is used for internal DNS resolution within a network. We can create several records as subdomains and use them to direct traffic to different IPs.

In the Route 53 service we also have health checks which check if a domain is healthy by trying to establish a TCP Connection.

We also have traffic policy in order to direct traffic depending on different aspects, such as the size of the traffic, or the clients. Using the bias feature when we use the geoproximity rule in traffic policy.
