Amazon RDS offers a multitude of features that can significantly enhance our application leveraging a relational database. These include capabilities such as read replicas for improved performance, Multi-AZ deployment for robust disaster recovery, support for multiple database engines, and automated functionalities like patching, backups, and scaling.

In terms of security, RDS provides IAM database authentication for access control, SSL/TLS encryption for secure transit of data, and KMS for encryption at rest. Additionally, it offers network isolation through VPC, ensuring a secure environment for our database operations.
