Amazon Elastic Block Store

Amazon Elastic Block Store is a high-performance block storage. We attach this into our EC2 instances, in order to provide it with persistent storage that is available and reliable. We can use it for a plethora of different applications. EBS can be attached prior or after runtime on a EC2 instance. by default we terminate on deletion of EC2 instance. EBS volumes can scale from gigabytes to terabytes, you can increase capacity at anytime to match application requirements. EBS volumes replicated within availability zone to protect against hardware failure, high availability and durability. Snapshots for backups of EBS volumes to Amazon S3, to ensure data durability and disaster recovery. EBS supports encryption at rest and in transit.
#### Best Practices
- **Snapshot Management**: Regularly create snapshots of your EBS volumes to ensure data backup and enable quick recovery.
- **Performance Tuning**: Choose the appropriate EBS volume type based on your application's performance requirements. For high IOPS needs, use Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes.
- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Utilize CloudWatch metrics to monitor EBS performance and set alarms for key metrics such as latency, throughput, and IOPS.
- **Security**: Enable encryption for EBS volumes containing sensitive data to ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.
