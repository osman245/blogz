I just finished andreis AWS CDA course right now... I am going to take several practice tests and then take my CDA on march 8. Right now i feel confident on around 70% of the material. A lot of things become intuitive as you go further along with your studies.. functionality of services overlap which makes it easier then other content ive studied for in the past. Another week of studies and proper preparation should be sufficient enough.
