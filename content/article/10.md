VPCs allows us to have network isolation for our resources.
VPCS have internet gateways which gives resources in the VPC seamless connection to the internet We also have NAT Gateways which facilitates outbound internet traffic for resources in private subnets while preserving their anonymity and security. We have NACL as a firewall at the subnet level. VPC Flow Logs to get extra data on how to capture info about IP going into the VPC.
