An Application that is fronted by an ALB, auto-scaling groups implemented in both availability zones, cross zone balancing feature is implemented which means we are directing traffic based on instance level not on an AZ level. This AZ implements health check and terminates any instance that is unhealthy. SNI( server name indication) is implemented so that we can handle and encrypt in-flight traffic going to different domains. Port 80 is the only listener as its type of traffic so we only accept http traffic. Added a listener and configured TLS termination. If a target group is sticky, requests routed to it remain in that target group for the duration of the session. Individual target stickiness is a configuration the target group.
